**Project Title: Password Strength Prediction with Machine Learning and Neural Networks**

**Description:**

This GitHub repository showcases a robust approach to predicting password strength using state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) techniques and Neural Networks, implemented with scikit-learn and TensorFlow. The primary objective of this project is to assess and enhance password security by developing a powerful classification model.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Text-to-Vector Transformation:** Password strings were converted into vector representations utilizing the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) methodology. This transformation allowed for the utilization of ML algorithms and Neural Networks.

- **Multi-class Classification:** We explored the suitability of various ML algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, for multi-class classification tasks. These algorithms were leveraged to classify password strength categories effectively.

- **Hyper-parameter Tuning:** To optimize model performance, we conducted hyper-parameter tuning using validation data. This step helped fine-tune the model's parameters for improved accuracy and efficiency.

- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs):** Building upon the success of traditional ML algorithms, we employed ANNs to further enhance the accuracy of password strength prediction. Through advanced neural network architectures, we achieved an impressive test accuracy of 99 percent, ensuring robust password strength assessment.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for those interested in cybersecurity, password security, and machine learning applications. The provided code and analysis offer insights into the transformation of textual data into meaningful features and the development of accurate models for password strength evaluation.
